  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>LavaCaveBot (“the Bot”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> The Bot only processes the information necessary to respond to your commands (such as floor/version selections). It does not store message content permanently.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Temporary data (like images or poll votes) may be stored in memory while the bot is running, but no long-term storage is used unless specified by server admins.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> The Bot does not sell or share your data with third parties.</li>
    <li><strong>User Rights:</strong> If you want data related to you to be deleted, contact the maintainer on Discord and it will be removed promptly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
